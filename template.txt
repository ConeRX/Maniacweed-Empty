Maniacweed empty template

This template is based on Tumbleweed and provides you with the full interface inspired by Thimbleweed Park and is supposed to be the basis for further templates for MMM or Mysteries of Ronville.
Read midi.txt in your games root directory on how to setup MIDI support if you need that.

Have fun!
